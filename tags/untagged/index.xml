      <description>Arch Linux Setup For My Borg-Collective of Devices My Mission: My ultimate goal every time I do this, is to improve personal performance and security, while also making things as quick and easy to set up as possible. This setup is only temporary (like they all are, really), until I learn to setup NixOS as it provides everything I could ask for within a system.
USB Installation: Just going to plop this in here for a quick reference in case I or you may need it.</description>

      <description>A Walkthrough I have finally found my perfect Plex setup, as shown in my post about setting up Artix (the subcategory about Servers is the example). My preferred setup is a boxed in Plex setup, to prevent access unwanted access from the UPnP ports.
