<p>And so are all the other things people can have. People really have a hard time seeing outside of themselves, I find. I feel like this is a fatal flaw in our character. I mean, we are the smartest people on earth, and the ones that have caused growth and progress in society are those that have taken the time to see others and learn how they think. Diversity is the key to a well rounded understanding of the world, and others I believe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to take the time to look into yourself, see your feelings. Do you have depression? BPD? Or do you just have a little anxiety? Do you have a victim complex? Learn all about yourself, not just the bad stuff, but the good stuff too. What are you good at? What makes you the happiest? Once you find that out, then look out at others as you see yourself. What do they feel?</p>
<p>I worry that&rsquo;s what people in my generation and future generations may lack. Sympathy, or empathy, for that matter. I make it a goal for myself, to embarrass myself, at least once a day. By doing so, you open yourself up to others in a way that you never could otherwise. Sharing in such an immense emotion can cause a bonding experience in yourself, and others involved, as well as a lasting, fond memory. I feel this is also another way to see into other people&rsquo;s souls, or characters.</p>
<p>Once you can find the signs in people, their micro-tells, you can start to see what makes people tick. Ah-ha! That&rsquo;s what makes retail tick! Also it just makes spending time with others just that much more fun. You get to learn how to get the reactions you want out of people; and in effect, go full circle and find yourself learning new things about yourself! Voila!</p>
