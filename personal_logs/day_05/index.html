<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on the Solus operating system (base kernel of Linux) for several months now (recently returned to Linux and all relevant things along from using a Macbook for a minute), as a laptop system, as well as for my server (boy was that a mistake).<br>
I&rsquo;ve reached that point however, where everything is superbly streamlined, and everything works without error, ever. AND IT&rsquo;S SO BORING. I&rsquo;ve always had the issue of being bored of my tech when I&rsquo;m not messing with it from the most basic levels. It&rsquo;s really hard to deal with this need to fuck with everything nowadays especially, due to my hardware finding itself becoming somewhat mission critical.<br>
No longer am I a student or someone that doesn&rsquo;t have expectations. I am expected to do things now, which my technology is involved in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m bringing this up, because I found the perfect install script for Arch Linux, and I just thought to myself, &ldquo;How amazing would it be to have a small base install of Arch Linux, and then build all my front-end apps through flatpak! I could guarantee a perfect experience every time with that, and could squeeze every clock of my CPU with that setup as well. But&hellip;. I already have that with my current setup. I&rsquo;m just antsy, and I wanna do the thing.<br>
So, now I hunt for a small laptop I can fuck with, and eventually probably turn into a testbed server&hellip; or some other B.S. thing I can come up with.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m so salty by the way. On my walk home from work today, I walked past a stack of servers&hellip;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Definitely all of them except for two were stripped of their guts&hellip; I assume those two were just jank as shit as well, but the not knowing is slowly eating away at me tonight. I may not survive this&hellip;</p>
