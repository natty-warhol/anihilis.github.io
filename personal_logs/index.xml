      <description>Colour Scheming is a Strange Beast I love pretty colours, but I hate having to set up my system with whole new colour scheming.
I&amp;rsquo;m working on swtiching from the Dracula theme to the Nord theme (I hate saturated work stations&amp;hellip; too busy for long term work). GODDAMN I just wish there was a way to set up all the different config files to respond to the Xresources&amp;hellip;.. hmm&amp;hellip; Maybe I could figure something out&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking, I feel like I should try out OpenBSD. I am finally in a situation where my current setup is fully realized, and fairly stable. Somehow though, all I can think about is how fun it would be to drop this system for something percievably more stable and secure.
The only thing holding me back is the fear of software stability for my photo and video editing, also will switching fuck up my ability to cheat and do some things with DRM?</description>

      <description>Media Sharing So, I have a Plex server, and I use it for myself, and my father, and partner. But they don&amp;rsquo;t ever really use it. My father goes out of his way to use it, and avoids talking about it. What&amp;rsquo;s going on? If it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working, they could just let me know what&amp;rsquo;s going on. What&amp;rsquo;s the psychology behind that?? If anyone ever comes across this blog (unlikely) feel free to hit me up and let me know at tasha_saphir@protonmail.</description>

      <description>Ugh Shit, yall. I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling pretty crappy the past few days, I even had to skip work!! What am I going to do? The nausea is real. I&amp;rsquo;m fairly certain it isn&amp;rsquo;t COVID. I have my suspicions that it&amp;rsquo;s maybe all the tear gas and such in the air right now, along with all the forest fires right now. I&amp;rsquo;m in Portland, for reference.
 In other news, I&amp;rsquo;ve never been more nervous about sirens than I am during these times&amp;hellip; I wonder why?</description>

      <description>Getting Away Sitting here on day 1 Million or so of our COVID trials, I watch Calvary, a film from 2014 with an all star cast of european actors (I don&amp;rsquo;t dare assume where they&amp;rsquo;re all from, I&amp;rsquo;m American and stupid). The film is about a Priest who is forced into a situation where a man angry at the Catholic church decides to kill a good priest for attention because of all the evils the bad priests have done.</description>

      <description>P.O.S. Point of Sale System I am working on a Proof of Concept POS System for my work, because I am tired of the constant problems presenting themselves when I least want them to. I am looking to switch to a completely disconnected, open source solution for work with multiple systems across two states and 5 stores. They are currently using very outdated (almost XP era) PCs with windows 10 locked down, with a shit POS system, and a terrible set up of permissions for apps and users.</description>

      <description>Is There a Better One? Is there a better version? Is there Another Version? Are there really infinite realities? Is my old boss really Batman?
Just a couple of questions.</description>

      <description>Artix Linux Security (Should This be put in Posts? Y.O.L.O. why not Both?) I&amp;rsquo;m on tiling! No buttons for me!! So yeah, I basically completely switched to using cli everything, and so for networking I am using NetworkManager, it&amp;rsquo;s been weird having to get used to it&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s like it&amp;rsquo;s too easy for me&amp;hellip; that I can&amp;rsquo;t figure it out? Like it makes sense, but&amp;hellip; I can&amp;rsquo;t use my intuiting? Anyways, I still can&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to use it with openvpn, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to use wireguard without a file&amp;hellip; and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to figure out if I have to make the file or what&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Switched My OS!! Huzzah! I have done it! I am free from Solus Linux!
Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I love the damned Operating System, I just started feeling claustrophobic with the systemd and the perfect UX and clean UI&amp;hellip; it was just&amp;hellip;. too perfect&amp;hellip;
So what did I switch to? I did a base install of Artix Linux! I love it so far! I went with the runit instance, because it seemed to have the best server/desktop useability.</description>

      <description>Am I Fat? I hate being told what to do with my health, I&amp;rsquo;ve been living with eating disorder all my life, and I like to think that I have gotten a grasp of things, have a logic, and a method. Which makes it all the more upsetting with someone comes around and decides they have to authority to tell me what to do with my body.
I don&amp;rsquo;t care what you think!</description>
