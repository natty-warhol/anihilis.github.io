      <description>It Finished! Thank the lordt! I&amp;rsquo;m grateful that downsizing a video file is a lot easier for my computer, because it only took an hour or so for it to do that after it FINALLY finished color correcting Frozen for me. OMG THO. It came out beautifully! Would I say that it&amp;rsquo;s worth the 2 weeks of processing time? Hell no. I&amp;rsquo;m trying it again on a copy of Maleficent, without the slowest preset turned on.</description>

      <description>Fuck you FFmpeg But not really, I love you, please come back.
HOLY SHIT I WISH I HAD A DEDICATED GPU. I am super excited about finally being able to offload all my work from one computer to a more powerful one in the comfort of my own home. The one big downfall however though, is that I get ambitious and decide it&amp;rsquo;s totally fine to just compress a fucking 10bit HDR version of Frozen into an SDR format, without even kind of expecting to have to wait more than two days for the damn thing to finish&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a whole week now and I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure how far along the process is!</description>

      <description>The Constant Need for Improvement It kills me. I have a dog-damned problem with organization. It&amp;rsquo;s like it&amp;rsquo;s the only thing that will get me off anymore is a well arranged stack of books, or a meticulousely organized filesystem to take it the nerdy way.
I almost find it infuriating at times however, how I am constantly changing what my systems are for and what they need to be able to do.</description>

      <description>Okay, so I finally install OpenBSD and goddamn, I miss it. Of course I got rid of it after a week and installed Arch Linux with herbstluftwm (my default setup for the past 10 years, despite trying to break it).
I really love OpenBSD, holy shit, it&amp;rsquo;s amazing, well put together, well secured, and has really good hardware support (for Lenovo at least), but has terrible software support. I figure it&amp;rsquo;s because of the security settings, but I can&amp;rsquo;t stand not being able to read out my battery status in live-time, as well as missed the ability to easily handle other filesystems and devices.</description>

      <description>I Watched my Grandfather die, and I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think that I still haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten over it. My mom&amp;rsquo;s father, was a shitty human being. He would beat my mom and her sisters, and he was uncomfortably racist, as well as just a terrible influence.
As a kid however, I didn&amp;rsquo;t see all that, I saw a man who was short in attitude, who would stand his ground, and knew what he wanted.</description>

      <description>OpenBSD still eludes me, and i have no idea what to do about it. It&amp;rsquo;s no longer installed on my computer, as I suddenly had things I had to do that work time-sensitive. I want to reinstall it, and I refuse to dual boot anything ever.
The lack of virtualization is also quite odd, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know how I&amp;rsquo;m going to get past that, cause god-damn is that a sexy OS or what (like, I would love to use it for my server-side work too)?</description>

      <description>I did it I installed OpenBSD onto my main computer, so far so good! The hardest part for me was setting up my touchpad (I like to turn it off and only use the trackpoint). I&amp;rsquo;ve still got a lot to do before I can call it production ready, but I&amp;rsquo;m really loving it! I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I got cold feet about it, this is the most fun I&amp;rsquo;ve had in a while!</description>

      <description>Colour Scheming is a Strange Beast I love pretty colours, but I hate having to set up my system with whole new colour scheming.
I&amp;rsquo;m working on swtiching from the Dracula theme to the Nord theme (I hate saturated work stations&amp;hellip; too busy for long term work). GODDAMN I just wish there was a way to set up all the different config files to respond to the Xresources&amp;hellip;.. hmm&amp;hellip; Maybe I could figure something out&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking, I feel like I should try out OpenBSD. I am finally in a situation where my current setup is fully realized, and fairly stable. Somehow though, all I can think about is how fun it would be to drop this system for something percievably more stable and secure.
The only thing holding me back is the fear of software stability for my photo and video editing, also will switching fuck up my ability to cheat and do some things with DRM?</description>

      <description>Media Sharing So, I have a Plex server, and I use it for myself, and my father, and partner. But they don&amp;rsquo;t ever really use it. My father goes out of his way to use it, and avoids talking about it. What&amp;rsquo;s going on? If it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working, they could just let me know what&amp;rsquo;s going on. What&amp;rsquo;s the psychology behind that?? If anyone ever comes across this blog (unlikely) feel free to hit me up and let me know at tasha_saphir@protonmail.</description>
