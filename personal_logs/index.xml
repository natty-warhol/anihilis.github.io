      <description>The Constant Need for Improvement It kills me. I have a dog-damned problem with organization. It&amp;rsquo;s like it&amp;rsquo;s the only thing that will get me off anymore is a well arranged stack of books, or a meticulousely organized filesystem to take it the nerdy way.
I almost find it infuriating at times however, how I am constantly changing what my systems are for and what they need to be able to do.</description>

      <description>Okay, so I finally install OpenBSD and goddamn, I miss it. Of course I got rid of it after a week and installed Arch Linux with herbstluftwm (my default setup for the past 10 years, despite trying to break it).
I really love OpenBSD, holy shit, it&amp;rsquo;s amazing, well put together, well secured, and has really good hardware support (for Lenovo at least), but has terrible software support. I figure it&amp;rsquo;s because of the security settings, but I can&amp;rsquo;t stand not being able to read out my battery status in live-time, as well as missed the ability to easily handle other filesystems and devices.</description>

      <description>I Watched my Grandfather die, and I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think that I still haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten over it. My mom&amp;rsquo;s father, was a shitty human being. He would beat my mom and her sisters, and he was uncomfortably racist, as well as just a terrible influence.
As a kid however, I didn&amp;rsquo;t see all that, I saw a man who was short in attitude, who would stand his ground, and knew what he wanted.</description>

      <description>OpenBSD still eludes me, and i have no idea what to do about it. It&amp;rsquo;s no longer installed on my computer, as I suddenly had things I had to do that work time-sensitive. I want to reinstall it, and I refuse to dual boot anything ever.
The lack of virtualization is also quite odd, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know how I&amp;rsquo;m going to get past that, cause god-damn is that a sexy OS or what (like, I would love to use it for my server-side work too)?</description>

      <description>I did it I installed OpenBSD onto my main computer, so far so good! The hardest part for me was setting up my touchpad (I like to turn it off and only use the trackpoint). I&amp;rsquo;ve still got a lot to do before I can call it production ready, but I&amp;rsquo;m really loving it! I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I got cold feet about it, this is the most fun I&amp;rsquo;ve had in a while!</description>

      <description>Colour Scheming is a Strange Beast I love pretty colours, but I hate having to set up my system with whole new colour scheming.
I&amp;rsquo;m working on swtiching from the Dracula theme to the Nord theme (I hate saturated work stations&amp;hellip; too busy for long term work). GODDAMN I just wish there was a way to set up all the different config files to respond to the Xresources&amp;hellip;.. hmm&amp;hellip; Maybe I could figure something out&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking, I feel like I should try out OpenBSD. I am finally in a situation where my current setup is fully realized, and fairly stable. Somehow though, all I can think about is how fun it would be to drop this system for something percievably more stable and secure.
The only thing holding me back is the fear of software stability for my photo and video editing, also will switching fuck up my ability to cheat and do some things with DRM?</description>

      <description>Media Sharing So, I have a Plex server, and I use it for myself, and my father, and partner. But they don&amp;rsquo;t ever really use it. My father goes out of his way to use it, and avoids talking about it. What&amp;rsquo;s going on? If it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working, they could just let me know what&amp;rsquo;s going on. What&amp;rsquo;s the psychology behind that?? If anyone ever comes across this blog (unlikely) feel free to hit me up and let me know at tasha_saphir@protonmail.</description>

      <description>Ugh Shit, yall. I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling pretty crappy the past few days, I even had to skip work!! What am I going to do? The nausea is real. I&amp;rsquo;m fairly certain it isn&amp;rsquo;t COVID. I have my suspicions that it&amp;rsquo;s maybe all the tear gas and such in the air right now, along with all the forest fires right now. I&amp;rsquo;m in Portland, for reference.
 In other news, I&amp;rsquo;ve never been more nervous about sirens than I am during these times&amp;hellip; I wonder why?</description>

      <description>Getting Away Sitting here on day 1 Million or so of our COVID trials, I watch Calvary, a film from 2014 with an all star cast of european actors (I don&amp;rsquo;t dare assume where they&amp;rsquo;re all from, I&amp;rsquo;m American and stupid). The film is about a Priest who is forced into a situation where a man angry at the Catholic church decides to kill a good priest for attention because of all the evils the bad priests have done.</description>
