      <description>My Dream for Dystopia I long that one day, we will be free from the confines of a rigged Republic and a suffocating Capitalist regime. No, but like, seriously. I really want all out anarchy. Not Mad Max folley, but like&amp;hellip;. Waterworld&amp;hellip;. or Willow. Fuck Star Wars though. I would rather suffer in the Sarlack pit than have to deal with that confusing mess. You&amp;rsquo;re either living in a Dictatorship, or in a society of people with stick-up-your-butt-itis.</description>

      <description>Day two on this blog&amp;hellip; My partner is signing up for Medicare right now, and I&amp;rsquo;m working on my internet security sheet. Her father is in town to help her out, I enjoy the company. With FISA being put to good use in Portland right now, I don&amp;rsquo;t really feel comfortable going outside right now. I don&amp;rsquo;t care if I&amp;rsquo;m a goody two-shoes that doesn&amp;rsquo;t do anything, I have friends, and there are others out there who are doing very dangerous things.</description>

      <description>AHHHH COVID Holy shit.
So now what? It&amp;rsquo;s almost the end of July, I have friends and family messaging me checking in, as if all of Portland were under complete turmoil. What?? I mean, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of protests going on. There&amp;rsquo;s also a lot of people getting infected, and lots of people dying from both problems. HOWEVER. I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending all my time inside, due to my partner, needing an intel facility to live in, essentially.</description>
