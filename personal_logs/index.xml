      <description>Media Sharing So, I have a Plex server, and I use it for myself, and my father, and partner. But they don&amp;rsquo;t ever really use it. My father goes out of his way to use it, and avoids talking about it. What&amp;rsquo;s going on? If it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working, they could just let me know what&amp;rsquo;s going on. What&amp;rsquo;s the psychology behind that?? If anyone ever comes across this blog (unlikely) feel free to hit me up and let me know at tasha_saphir@protonmail.</description>

      <description>Ugh Shit, yall. I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling pretty crappy the past few days, I even had to skip work!! What am I going to do? The nausea is real. I&amp;rsquo;m fairly certain it isn&amp;rsquo;t COVID. I have my suspicions that it&amp;rsquo;s maybe all the tear gas and such in the air right now, along with all the forest fires right now. I&amp;rsquo;m in Portland, for reference.
 In other news, I&amp;rsquo;ve never been more nervous about sirens than I am during these times&amp;hellip; I wonder why?</description>

      <description>Getting Away Sitting here on day 1 Million or so of our COVID trials, I watch Calvary, a film from 2014 with an all star cast of european actors (I don&amp;rsquo;t dare assume where they&amp;rsquo;re all from, I&amp;rsquo;m American and stupid). The film is about a Priest who is forced into a situation where a man angry at the Catholic church decides to kill a good priest for attention because of all the evils the bad priests have done.</description>

      <description>P.O.S. Point of Sale System I am working on a Proof of Concept POS System for my work, because I am tired of the constant problems presenting themselves when I least want them to. I am looking to switch to a completely disconnected, open source solution for work with multiple systems across two states and 5 stores. They are currently using very outdated (almost XP era) PCs with windows 10 locked down, with a shit POS system, and a terrible set up of permissions for apps and users.</description>

      <description>Is There a Better One? Is there a better version? Is there Another Version? Are there really infinite realities? Is my old boss really Batman?
Just a couple of questions.</description>

      <description>Artix Linux Security (Should This be put in Posts? Y.O.L.O. why not Both?) I&amp;rsquo;m on tiling! No buttons for me!! So yeah, I basically completely switched to using cli everything, and so for networking I am using NetworkManager, it&amp;rsquo;s been weird having to get used to it&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s like it&amp;rsquo;s too easy for me&amp;hellip; that I can&amp;rsquo;t figure it out? Like it makes sense, but&amp;hellip; I can&amp;rsquo;t use my intuiting? Anyways, I still can&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to use it with openvpn, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to use wireguard without a file&amp;hellip; and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to figure out if I have to make the file or what&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Switched My OS!! Huzzah! I have done it! I am free from Solus Linux!
Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I love the damned Operating System, I just started feeling claustrophobic with the systemd and the perfect UX and clean UI&amp;hellip; it was just&amp;hellip;. too perfect&amp;hellip;
So what did I switch to? I did a base install of Artix Linux! I love it so far! I went with the runit instance, because it seemed to have the best server/desktop useability.</description>

      <description>Am I Fat? I hate being told what to do with my health, I&amp;rsquo;ve been living with eating disorder all my life, and I like to think that I have gotten a grasp of things, have a logic, and a method. Which makes it all the more upsetting with someone comes around and decides they have to authority to tell me what to do with my body.
I don&amp;rsquo;t care what you think!</description>

      <description>Embarrassment How often do you embarrass yourself? I do almost hourly, often I&amp;rsquo;m embarrassed way before I even begin doing the thing that caused such hard to spell feelings. For me, however, this feeling is often a side-effect of my anxiety. For instance, right now; I&amp;rsquo;m just sitting here, eating taquitos, writing this post. All I&amp;rsquo;m think about though, is my partner coming home, and seeing the empty box&amp;hellip;. Also it&amp;rsquo;s the only thing I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten today.</description>

      <description>Using Solus I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the Solus operating system (base kernel of Linux) for several months now (recently returned to Linux and all relevant things along from using a Macbook for a minute), as a laptop system, as well as for my server (boy was that a mistake).
I&amp;rsquo;ve reached that point however, where everything is superbly streamlined, and everything works without error, ever. AND IT&amp;rsquo;S SO BORING. I&amp;rsquo;ve always had the issue of being bored of my tech when I&amp;rsquo;m not messing with it from the most basic levels.</description>
