      <description>A New Project Found. I am going to watch all of the Spongbob series.. At least as much as I find the internet tells me is needed. For I lack a complete and utter understanding as to what a large majority of my friends are saying. Apparently, I grew up in a generation of people that watched Spongebob, and I just entirely missed out on it existing until I was older.</description>

      <description>Depression is Real. And so are all the other things people can have. People really have a hard time seeing outside of themselves, I find. I feel like this is a fatal flaw in our character. I mean, we are the smartest people on earth, and the ones that have caused growth and progress in society are those that have taken the time to see others and learn how they think.</description>

      <description>The Futility of Socializing I think I&amp;rsquo;m at my wits end y&amp;rsquo;all. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I care for people enough to ever want to socialize with them really anymore. Complacency towards people isn&amp;rsquo;t really a new thing for me, but this level of &amp;lsquo;not giving a fuck&amp;rsquo; is too high to comprehend.
After all the bullshit I&amp;rsquo;ve had to deal with in just this month; with my work, my family, and my now ex-partner, why should I have time for anyone, if no one has time for me?</description>

      <description>I hate Google and it&amp;rsquo;s not even that personal; like it is, they&amp;rsquo;re a terrible company and need to be split up like five years ago, but that&amp;rsquo;s not what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about today.
Holy shit, I hate android phones. I almost want to go back to a dumb phone, but ironically, somehow those are even less secure now that everyone is tracking everything. Honestly, if Google (and other phone providers) would stop shoving all their own services into their phones I would probably feel a lot better.</description>

      <description>It Finished! Thank the lordt! I&amp;rsquo;m grateful that downsizing a video file is a lot easier for my computer, because it only took an hour or so for it to do that after it FINALLY finished color correcting Frozen for me. OMG THO. It came out beautifully! Would I say that it&amp;rsquo;s worth the 2 weeks of processing time? Hell no. I&amp;rsquo;m trying it again on a copy of Maleficent, without the slowest preset turned on.</description>

      <description>Fuck you FFmpeg But not really, I love you, please come back.
HOLY SHIT I WISH I HAD A DEDICATED GPU. I am super excited about finally being able to offload all my work from one computer to a more powerful one in the comfort of my own home. The one big downfall however though, is that I get ambitious and decide it&amp;rsquo;s totally fine to just compress a fucking 10bit HDR version of Frozen into an SDR format, without even kind of expecting to have to wait more than two days for the damn thing to finish&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a whole week now and I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure how far along the process is!</description>

      <description>The Constant Need for Improvement It kills me. I have a dog-damned problem with organization. It&amp;rsquo;s like it&amp;rsquo;s the only thing that will get me off anymore is a well arranged stack of books, or a meticulousely organized filesystem to take it the nerdy way.
I almost find it infuriating at times however, how I am constantly changing what my systems are for and what they need to be able to do.</description>

      <description>Okay, so I finally install OpenBSD and goddamn, I miss it. Of course I got rid of it after a week and installed Arch Linux with herbstluftwm (my default setup for the past 10 years, despite trying to break it).
I really love OpenBSD, holy shit, it&amp;rsquo;s amazing, well put together, well secured, and has really good hardware support (for Lenovo at least), but has terrible software support. I figure it&amp;rsquo;s because of the security settings, but I can&amp;rsquo;t stand not being able to read out my battery status in live-time, as well as missed the ability to easily handle other filesystems and devices.</description>

      <description>I Watched my Grandfather die, and I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think that I still haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten over it. My mom&amp;rsquo;s father, was a shitty human being. He would beat my mom and her sisters, and he was uncomfortably racist, as well as just a terrible influence.
As a kid however, I didn&amp;rsquo;t see all that, I saw a man who was short in attitude, who would stand his ground, and knew what he wanted.</description>

      <description>OpenBSD still eludes me, and i have no idea what to do about it. It&amp;rsquo;s no longer installed on my computer, as I suddenly had things I had to do that work time-sensitive. I want to reinstall it, and I refuse to dual boot anything ever.
The lack of virtualization is also quite odd, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know how I&amp;rsquo;m going to get past that, cause god-damn is that a sexy OS or what (like, I would love to use it for my server-side work too)?</description>
