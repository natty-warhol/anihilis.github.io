<p>and I&rsquo;m starting to think that I still haven&rsquo;t gotten over it. My mom&rsquo;s father, was a shitty human being. He would beat my mom and her sisters, and he was uncomfortably racist, as well as just a terrible influence.</p>
<p>As a kid however, I didn&rsquo;t see all that, I saw a man who was short in attitude, who would stand his ground, and knew what he wanted. When I knew him, he was already dying.</p>
<p>He had picked up smoking when he was ten or eleven years old, and never gave it up. Growing up to be a good ol' boy, definitely from the era of &ldquo;The Outsiders&rdquo;. I often imagine him younger, as a greaser, working on his cars (as his profession for as long as I knew him, was working on cars).</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t per se, tell you the first time I ever met the man, because, he&rsquo;s my grandfather, and he met me before I met him. I can say that he was always the same person whenever I saw him. He was a man of little speech, and what he did say, counted; whether it was for entertainment or to make a point.</p>
<p>He was a terrible man for every reason, but he was the one I somehow chose to look up to as someone to be like. Probably because my mom liked him so much for some reason. Which I never understood, and still don&rsquo;t understand, considering all the things she&rsquo;s told me about how he used to treat her and her siblings.</p>
<p>Anyway, after at least a decade of being diagnosed with lung cancer, he finally tells my mom and her family, and everyone goes into a frenzy, my grandmother does everything she can to keep him alive.</p>
<p>At this point though, they can&rsquo;t really do much, because it had spread, and it&rsquo;s reaching the brain. That was terrifying for me to try to conceive at the time, so I can only imagine having to approach that now, as an adult. He reaches the point of getting things cross-wired in his mind, losing memories, and confusing people with others he&rsquo;d known.</p>
<p>A memory I have of the family trying to bring light to the deafeningly upsetting situation: Once things got darker, there was a point where he had told my uncle he needed to check the mail, and instead of heading for the mail boxes, he trailed back to the yard, and continued to go to the restroom. From then on we knew that checking the mail meant Grandpa needed to use the restroom.</p>
<p>That otherwise further evidence of something no one wants to accept, is turned into a funny situation, where we could all laugh, and save for later the fact that time was closing in.</p>
<p>Hospice was his last wish, as he hated doctors, and wanted nothing to do with them, which is the extent to why I know he didn&rsquo;t tell anyone about his cancer.</p>
<p>The last time we visited before the funeral, I still remember the morning, watching him blink his eyes for the last time. I don&rsquo;t remember the time, but that it was unbearably early, and no one else had woken quite yet. I was staring at him pretty intently, thinking about why I was going to miss him. I still wonder about that. I miss him so much, but really, he was kind of a terrible guy.</p>
<hr>
<p>Those 4th of Julys though. I don&rsquo;t celebrate it anymore, but when we would as a family, he was the one that would procure all the activities and foods. He really was the life of the parties whenever we did have parties. While he was around people could bare to be together, because he kinda broke in some light/dark humour. He also never gave a rats ass about anything.</p>
<p>I guess maybe I&rsquo;ve just forgotten the good memories of why I might have taken so much after him in personality, and chosen to see only the bad (but I mean, it&rsquo;s kind hard not to, when those things are pretty bad).</p>
<p>Either way, everyone&rsquo;s three-dimensional, and I really need to work on not beating myself up on being so much like people I despise. There&rsquo;s more to people than their principle or ethics. We don&rsquo;t love hulk hogan for his opinions, and thank god we don&rsquo;t.</p>
