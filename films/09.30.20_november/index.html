<p><em>A quick introduction into what all this is going to be&hellip;</em>
Welcome! It is the end of September and the beginning of Fall, and I am here to begin my Spooky Movie Marathon! My current partner is not very accustomed to movies, much less ones that take on a <em>edgier</em> look of the world. I&rsquo;m writing these reviews for my own fun, as all I hope to do really is show my partner the arts and stories that good movies have to tell!</p>
<p>I hope you join in and watch along with us! There&rsquo;s some Gems!</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re talking about November, a fun little film from 2017 about an Estonian village from a time similar to that of your classical fairy tales.<br>
The Director is Rainer Sarnet, and the Writers Andrus Kivirahk, and Sarnet (again). I don&rsquo;t know much about Andrus, the author of the Novel this is based on seemingly, though they do have several credits for other Shorts, and TV Pieces. Sarnet is most recognized (by me) from The Idiot (2011), and Where Souls Go (2007).<br>
This movie is a bit of a departure from the others, in the sense of aesthetic choices; he does go for a more edgier fantasy feel with this one, and pulls it off beautifully. However the content of the film is reminiscient of his other works, in the sense that these are movies about people and they&rsquo;re relations with others, and the consequences.<br>
This film goes the direction of &ldquo;unrequited love&rdquo;, and does it in a most gracious and involved way. It follows the characters Liina(female protagonist), Hans(male protagonist), and Rein(Liina&rsquo;s father) as they try to communicate to eachother and fail at every turn.<br>
It starts off with Liina, having a feelings for Hans, which is appropriate in this society (as they are both peasants, and are equally matched in direness of emotions). On a later day though, the boy Hans meets the girl baroness from the estate just out of town, which belongs to her father, the baron (played by Dieter Laser). He decides he&rsquo;s not just lustful for her, but madly in love, just after one short meeting.<br>
This movie is a wonderful film with little to dig deep into, it is quite simply a beautiful film about young heartbreak, and it has everyone&rsquo;s favorite, a sad ending, lacking in closure.<br>
The so-called Krats in the film are probably the most exciting part, as they are practical effects (thrown together by the characters of the movie with sticks and blades and other random pieces), and sassy as all hell!
The cinematographer, Mart Taniel, which is a new name to me, does a miraculous job putting this film together. If anything, this could be the perfect vessel to display his work. He works well with the lighting, and finding texture and contrast is clearly a strong suit for him. The aesthetic vaguely reminds me of old-school anime, with external cuts of snowfall, and closeups of the Kratts, he played well at expressing the feelings and moods that this film asked for, and did it with grace. I&rsquo;m certainly to watch as many of his other works as I can come across!<br>
The production team also must have had a field day with this, with a hyper-accurate representation of the world of the times. Low hanging ceilings and cooking in the fireplace, beyond that, the intricacies taken to preserve such a fantastical but seemingly down to earth environment is truly exciting! I feel like I could just reach out and enter the room myself.. despite being a black and white movie with the cinematic 1.85:1 aspect ratio.<br>
This movie simply leaves me begging for more, not of this story, as it&rsquo;s wrapped beautifully, and needs no more explanation; but instead begging for more experiences like this one. Everyone that worked on this story really did the most, and it shows. It will be hard to top this one!</p>
