<p>1408 is a much more well known film, about an author who has essentially given up on his life and succumbed to gluttony by only writing books about &lsquo;haunted&rsquo; places and living solo (It&rsquo;s later explained that he left his wife after the death of their daughter). In the shit of his turmoil, he comes across a new lead for a potential &lsquo;scare spot&rsquo; that just so happens to be in New York, where is wife lives.<br>
The movie was directed by Mikael Hafstrom, written by three Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski. It was based on a short story by Stephen King, and it shows. Though I haven&rsquo;t delved into who did what beyond their credits, they all really seemed to get together and do a bang up job.<br>
It stars John Cusack as Mike Enslin, the main character, who as described earlier is experiencing the loss of his daughter in the worst ways possible (leaving his wife without a word, changing his career from quality authoring to debunking haunted spaces, and drinking every chance he gets). While checking his mail one day, he comes across a postcard telling him not to go into room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel. Of course he takes this as a challenge and then continues to find every way to get into that room, even with Samuel L. Jackson (the head of the hotel) trying everything he can to convince him not to.
There&rsquo;s not much to get into with this movie, as it is quite straight forward&hellip; also I want to refrain from revealing to much more about it for y&rsquo;all&hellip; However, the set design, and the writing is the clearly of a high quality. It really refrains when it needs to only revealing when it absolutely has to, using apparitions, and (the right kind of) communication between the characters. The editors as well I bet had a hay day with this one as well, as there are several times they cut in just the right way to make the incoherent coherent, and that which must remain in shadows there. It was also pretty clever how they had it extra hard to tell if what you are seeing is really there, considering it does all take place from the perspective of John Cusack/Mike Enslin.<br>
All in all, I would give this movie a 10/10, though it&rsquo;s really not that scary, especially as you get further into it, it does give you a very interesting and creative story/plot that certainly lingers on you for a while.</p>
