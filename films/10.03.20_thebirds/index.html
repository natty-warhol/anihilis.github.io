<p>&ldquo;A wealthy San Francisco socialite pursues a potential boyfriend to a small Northern California town that slowly takes a turn for the bizarre when birds of all kinds suddenly begin to attack people&rdquo;. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, with a screenplay by Evan Hunter and based off a story by Daphne Du Maurier. Right off the bat, this movie gets an automatic pass from me.<br>
I&rsquo;ve been watching this film since I was a wee child, and every time I watch it, I still notice something new about it. This movie never fails to excite the senses either, with the unbearably (by today&rsquo;s standards) slow introduction credits over dubbed with birds cawing all encompassing, for instance.<br>
Onward into the film, it really does one good by showing through not-awkward dialogue, and &ldquo;showing instead of telling&rdquo;. The main lady Tippi Hedren, being exposed as kind of a happy-go-lucky character, breaking laws and lacking cares because of her priviliged upbringing and lifestyle. Being exposed by the supported main man, Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor), who is a character we learn about throughout the movie, as a caring older brother who has kind of become a father figure in the household since the loss of his father.<br>
This movie does really well with what is has to offer, as well as what with the technological limitations of the time. A million out of a million for this bad boy. Hard recommend if you haven&rsquo;t seen this one yet.</p>
