      <description>Goodnight Mommy (2014) Damn the Austrians know how to have a good time. &amp;ldquo;Twin boys move to a new home with their mother after she has face changing cosmetic surgery, but under her bandages is someone the children don&amp;rsquo;t recognize.&amp;rdquo;
Starring Lukas and Elias Schwarz as themselves, and Susanne Wuest as Mutter (German for Mother). The movie is in german, and it&amp;rsquo;s based in rural Austria, with some of the most warming visuals of the country.</description>

      <description>The Hidden (1987) I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to freak out and say &amp;ldquo;OMG&amp;rdquo;, but..
OMG I love anything with Kyle MacLachlan in it, everything I watch with him in it, is amazing, and weird, and awkward; just like him. This movie is no different.
Starring that bad boy Kyle (Lloyd Gallagher) alongside Michael Nouri (Tom Beck), as a kind of buddy-cop movie meets the bodysnatchers. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to give this movie away, so I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be vague with is as well (Like the other times).</description>

      <description>The Neon Demon (2016) Another wonderful film by Nicolas Winding Refn. This guy knows what&amp;rsquo;s up.
Starring the highly esteemed Keanu Reeves, and the young Elle Fanning (almost uncomfortably so), this one is about a lot of things, and I feel it&amp;rsquo;s up to your interpretation where you take it. Elle Fanning plays Jesse, an underage (fittingly so, because she was underage by a year as well while acting this movie.</description>

      <description>An American Werewolf in London (1981) Starring Jenny Agutter (Nurse Alex Price), Griffin Dunne (Jack Goodman), and David Naughton (David Kessler), this is the best combination of reality and comedy put into one wholesome package.
It starts off with Jack and David getting into their adventures in rural Britain, happening upon a small town, hoping for a meal to eat. After experiencing some strange interactions with the locals, and a foreshadowing warning (not recieving a meal, upsettingly), they continue onto their journey until misfortune reaches them and Jack is taken from life.</description>

      <description>Event Horizon (1997) Damn does this movie get a lot of slack for it&amp;rsquo;s kind of shitty ending and all, also it kinda goes into the substanceless a bit; but I love it! It&amp;rsquo;s a campy mess! Also the effects are pretty alright considering when it came out.
&amp;ldquo;A rescue crew investigates a spaceship that disappeared into a black hole and has now returned&amp;hellip;with someone or something new on-board.&amp;rdquo;, starring Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill, this movie, I feel, takes advantage of these two actors beautifully.</description>

      <description>The Birds (1963) &amp;ldquo;A wealthy San Francisco socialite pursues a potential boyfriend to a small Northern California town that slowly takes a turn for the bizarre when birds of all kinds suddenly begin to attack people&amp;rdquo;. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, with a screenplay by Evan Hunter and based off a story by Daphne Du Maurier. Right off the bat, this movie gets an automatic pass from me.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching this film since I was a wee child, and every time I watch it, I still notice something new about it.</description>

      <description>1408 (2007) 1408 is a much more well known film, about an author who has essentially given up on his life and succumbed to gluttony by only writing books about &amp;lsquo;haunted&amp;rsquo; places and living solo (It&amp;rsquo;s later explained that he left his wife after the death of their daughter). In the shit of his turmoil, he comes across a new lead for a potential &amp;lsquo;scare spot&amp;rsquo; that just so happens to be in New York, where is wife lives.</description>

      <description>Pee Mak (2013) Day 2 of the marathon Pee Mak, Directed by Banjong Pisanthanakun, and Written by Chantavit Dhanasevi, and Nontra Kumwong. This is the first Thai movie I&amp;rsquo;ve seen; and I love it!! This is a Comedy/Horror about a couple of guys coming home from war, only to find out one of their wives is actually a ghost! It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty funny take on usually pretty scary hauntings similar to what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen from Ju-on or The Wailing and so on&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The Marathon Begins With: November (2017) A quick introduction into what all this is going to be&amp;hellip; Welcome! It is the end of September and the beginning of Fall, and I am here to begin my Spooky Movie Marathon! My current partner is not very accustomed to movies, much less ones that take on a edgier look of the world. I&amp;rsquo;m writing these reviews for my own fun, as all I hope to do really is show my partner the arts and stories that good movies have to tell!</description>
