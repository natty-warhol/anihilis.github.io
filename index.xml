      <description>Plex Server Updated [Stable Edition] In my Many Journeys I find myself hopelessly trying to find the cleanest most efficient way to get the things I want done, done. I have hopes to maybe make another one of these soon, instead using FreeBSD as hopefully a final home for all my server needs, but until I become comfortable with that world, I&amp;rsquo;m going to focus on using Linux in the most organized way possible.</description>

      <description>OpenBSD still eludes me, and i have no idea what to do about it. It&amp;rsquo;s no longer installed on my computer, as I suddenly had things I had to do that work time-sensitive. I want to reinstall it, and I refuse to dual boot anything ever.
The lack of virtualization is also quite odd, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know how I&amp;rsquo;m going to get past that, cause god-damn is that a sexy OS or what (like, I would love to use it for my server-side work too)?</description>

      <description>Goodnight Mommy (2014) Damn the Austrians know how to have a good time. &amp;ldquo;Twin boys move to a new home with their mother after she has face changing cosmetic surgery, but under her bandages is someone the children don&amp;rsquo;t recognize.&amp;rdquo;
Starring Lukas and Elias Schwarz as themselves, and Susanne Wuest as Mutter (German for Mother). The movie is in german, and it&amp;rsquo;s based in rural Austria, with some of the most warming visuals of the country.</description>

      <description>The Hidden (1987) I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to freak out and say &amp;ldquo;OMG&amp;rdquo;, but..
OMG I love anything with Kyle MacLachlan in it, everything I watch with him in it, is amazing, and weird, and awkward; just like him. This movie is no different.
Starring that bad boy Kyle (Lloyd Gallagher) alongside Michael Nouri (Tom Beck), as a kind of buddy-cop movie meets the bodysnatchers. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to give this movie away, so I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be vague with is as well (Like the other times).</description>

      <description>The Neon Demon (2016) Another wonderful film by Nicolas Winding Refn. This guy knows what&amp;rsquo;s up.
Starring the highly esteemed Keanu Reeves, and the young Elle Fanning (almost uncomfortably so), this one is about a lot of things, and I feel it&amp;rsquo;s up to your interpretation where you take it. Elle Fanning plays Jesse, an underage (fittingly so, because she was underage by a year as well while acting this movie.</description>

      <description>An American Werewolf in London (1981) Starring Jenny Agutter (Nurse Alex Price), Griffin Dunne (Jack Goodman), and David Naughton (David Kessler), this is the best combination of reality and comedy put into one wholesome package.
It starts off with Jack and David getting into their adventures in rural Britain, happening upon a small town, hoping for a meal to eat. After experiencing some strange interactions with the locals, and a foreshadowing warning (not recieving a meal, upsettingly), they continue onto their journey until misfortune reaches them and Jack is taken from life.</description>

      <description>Event Horizon (1997) Damn does this movie get a lot of slack for it&amp;rsquo;s kind of shitty ending and all, also it kinda goes into the substanceless a bit; but I love it! It&amp;rsquo;s a campy mess! Also the effects are pretty alright considering when it came out.
&amp;ldquo;A rescue crew investigates a spaceship that disappeared into a black hole and has now returned&amp;hellip;with someone or something new on-board.&amp;rdquo;, starring Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill, this movie, I feel, takes advantage of these two actors beautifully.</description>

      <description>I did it I installed OpenBSD onto my main computer, so far so good! The hardest part for me was setting up my touchpad (I like to turn it off and only use the trackpoint). I&amp;rsquo;ve still got a lot to do before I can call it production ready, but I&amp;rsquo;m really loving it! I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I got cold feet about it, this is the most fun I&amp;rsquo;ve had in a while!</description>

      <description>The Birds (1963) &amp;ldquo;A wealthy San Francisco socialite pursues a potential boyfriend to a small Northern California town that slowly takes a turn for the bizarre when birds of all kinds suddenly begin to attack people&amp;rdquo;. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, with a screenplay by Evan Hunter and based off a story by Daphne Du Maurier. Right off the bat, this movie gets an automatic pass from me.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching this film since I was a wee child, and every time I watch it, I still notice something new about it.</description>

      <description>1408 (2007) 1408 is a much more well known film, about an author who has essentially given up on his life and succumbed to gluttony by only writing books about &amp;lsquo;haunted&amp;rsquo; places and living solo (It&amp;rsquo;s later explained that he left his wife after the death of their daughter). In the shit of his turmoil, he comes across a new lead for a potential &amp;lsquo;scare spot&amp;rsquo; that just so happens to be in New York, where is wife lives.</description>
