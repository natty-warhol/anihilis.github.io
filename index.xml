      <description>Plex Server Updated [Stable Edition] In my Many Journeys I find myself hopelessly trying to find the cleanest most efficient way to get the things I want done, done. I have hopes to maybe make another one of these soon, instead using FreeBSD as hopefully a final home for all my server needs, but until I become comfortable with that world, I&amp;rsquo;m going to focus on using Linux in the most organized way possible.</description>

      <description>OpenBSD still eludes me, and i have no idea what to do about it. It&amp;rsquo;s no longer installed on my computer, as I suddenly had things I had to do that work time-sensitive. I want to reinstall it, and I refuse to dual boot anything ever.
The lack of virtualization is also quite odd, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know how I&amp;rsquo;m going to get past that, cause god-damn is that a sexy OS or what (like, I would love to use it for my server-side work too)?</description>

      <description>The Void (2016) &amp;ldquo;Shortly after delivering a patient to an understaffed hospital, a police officer experiences strange and violent occurences seemingly linked to a group of mysterious hooded figures.&amp;rdquo; - IMDb
Uhuh.
Well shit, buddy, If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a good old raucus time of, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s going on, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really care because look, pretty lights!&amp;rdquo;, then this is the movie for you. It&amp;rsquo;s thematically based off of lovecraftian stuff, and it definitely fits the bill almost perfectly.</description>

      <description>Possum (2018) &amp;ldquo;After returning to his childhood home, a disgraced children&amp;rsquo;s puppeteer is forced to confront his wicked stepfather and the secrets that have tortured his entire life.&amp;rdquo;
Directed by Matthew Holness, starring Sean Harris (Philip), and Alun Armstrong (Maurice &amp;ndash; the stepfather).
HOLY SHIT is this movie heavy or what. This goes through childhood trauma, and how the main character deals with it, and has been dealing with it, and will continue to deal with it.</description>

      <description>The Wailing (2016) The recent &amp;ldquo;asian invasion&amp;rdquo; (in reference to the british invasion) of horror films, is probably my most favorite part of these past recent years. The Wailing is no exception to that rule.
Directed by Hong-Jin Na, and starring Do-Won Kwak and Jong-goo.
God this movie does real right. This is a movie that centers around a father and how he copes with a sudden illness entering his town and affecting his daughter.</description>

      <description>Goodnight Mommy (2014) Damn the Austrians know how to have a good time. &amp;ldquo;Twin boys move to a new home with their mother after she has face changing cosmetic surgery, but under her bandages is someone the children don&amp;rsquo;t recognize.&amp;rdquo;
Starring Lukas and Elias Schwarz as themselves, and Susanne Wuest as Mutter (German for Mother). The movie is in german, and it&amp;rsquo;s based in rural Austria, with some of the most warming visuals of the country.</description>

      <description>The Hidden (1987) I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to freak out and say &amp;ldquo;OMG&amp;rdquo;, but..
OMG I love anything with Kyle MacLachlan in it, everything I watch with him in it, is amazing, and weird, and awkward; just like him. This movie is no different.
Starring that bad boy Kyle (Lloyd Gallagher) alongside Michael Nouri (Tom Beck), as a kind of buddy-cop movie meets the bodysnatchers. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to give this movie away, so I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be vague with is as well (Like the other times).</description>

      <description>The Neon Demon (2016) Another wonderful film by Nicolas Winding Refn. This guy knows what&amp;rsquo;s up.
Starring the highly esteemed Keanu Reeves, and the young Elle Fanning (almost uncomfortably so), this one is about a lot of things, and I feel it&amp;rsquo;s up to your interpretation where you take it. Elle Fanning plays Jesse, an underage (fittingly so, because she was underage by a year as well while acting this movie.</description>

      <description>An American Werewolf in London (1981) Starring Jenny Agutter (Nurse Alex Price), Griffin Dunne (Jack Goodman), and David Naughton (David Kessler), this is the best combination of reality and comedy put into one wholesome package.
It starts off with Jack and David getting into their adventures in rural Britain, happening upon a small town, hoping for a meal to eat. After experiencing some strange interactions with the locals, and a foreshadowing warning (not recieving a meal, upsettingly), they continue onto their journey until misfortune reaches them and Jack is taken from life.</description>
