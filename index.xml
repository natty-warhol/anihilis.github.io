      <description>Okay, so I finally install OpenBSD and goddamn, I miss it. Of course I got rid of it after a week and installed Arch Linux with herbstluftwm (my default setup for the past 10 years, despite trying to break it).
I really love OpenBSD, holy shit, it&amp;rsquo;s amazing, well put together, well secured, and has really good hardware support (for Lenovo at least), but has terrible software support. I figure it&amp;rsquo;s because of the security settings, but I can&amp;rsquo;t stand not being able to read out my battery status in live-time, as well as missed the ability to easily handle other filesystems and devices.</description>

      <description>I Watched my Grandfather die, and I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think that I still haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten over it. My mom&amp;rsquo;s father, was a shitty human being. He would beat my mom and her sisters, and he was uncomfortably racist, as well as just a terrible influence.
As a kid however, I didn&amp;rsquo;t see all that, I saw a man who was short in attitude, who would stand his ground, and knew what he wanted.</description>

      <description>Plex Server Updated [Stable Edition] In my Many Journeys I find myself hopelessly trying to find the cleanest most efficient way to get the things I want done, done. I have hopes to maybe make another one of these soon, instead using FreeBSD as hopefully a final home for all my server needs, but until I become comfortable with that world, I&amp;rsquo;m going to focus on using Linux in the most organized way possible.</description>

      <description>OpenBSD still eludes me, and i have no idea what to do about it. It&amp;rsquo;s no longer installed on my computer, as I suddenly had things I had to do that work time-sensitive. I want to reinstall it, and I refuse to dual boot anything ever.
The lack of virtualization is also quite odd, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know how I&amp;rsquo;m going to get past that, cause god-damn is that a sexy OS or what (like, I would love to use it for my server-side work too)?</description>

      <description>The Void (2016) &amp;ldquo;Shortly after delivering a patient to an understaffed hospital, a police officer experiences strange and violent occurences seemingly linked to a group of mysterious hooded figures.&amp;rdquo; - IMDb
Uhuh.
Well shit, buddy, If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a good old raucus time of, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s going on, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really care because look, pretty lights!&amp;rdquo;, then this is the movie for you. It&amp;rsquo;s thematically based off of lovecraftian stuff, and it definitely fits the bill almost perfectly.</description>

Directed by Matthew Holness, starring Sean Harris (Philip), and Alun Armstrong (Maurice &amp;ndash; the stepfather).
HOLY SHIT is this movie heavy or what. This goes through childhood trauma, and how the main character deals with it, and has been dealing with it, and will continue to deal with it.</description>

      <description>The Wailing (2016) The recent &amp;ldquo;asian invasion&amp;rdquo; (in reference to the british invasion) of horror films, is probably my most favorite part of these past recent years. The Wailing is no exception to that rule.
Directed by Hong-Jin Na, and starring Do-Won Kwak and Jong-goo.
God this movie does real right. This is a movie that centers around a father and how he copes with a sudden illness entering his town and affecting his daughter.</description>

      <description>The Hidden (1987) I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to freak out and say &amp;ldquo;OMG&amp;rdquo;, but..
OMG I love anything with Kyle MacLachlan in it, everything I watch with him in it, is amazing, and weird, and awkward; just like him. This movie is no different.
Starring that bad boy Kyle (Lloyd Gallagher) alongside Michael Nouri (Tom Beck), as a kind of buddy-cop movie meets the bodysnatchers. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to give this movie away, so I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be vague with is as well (Like the other times).</description>
