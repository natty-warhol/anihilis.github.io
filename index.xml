      <description>The Marathon Begins With: November (2017) A quick introduction into what all this is going to be&amp;hellip; Welcome! It is the end of September and the beginning of Fall, and I am here to begin my Spooky Movie Marathon! My current partner is not very accustomed to movies, much less ones that take on a edgier look of the world. I&amp;rsquo;m writing these reviews for my own fun, as all I hope to do really is show my partner the arts and stories that good movies have to tell!</description>

      <description>Colour Scheming is a Strange Beast I love pretty colours, but I hate having to set up my system with whole new colour scheming.
I&amp;rsquo;m working on swtiching from the Dracula theme to the Nord theme (I hate saturated work stations&amp;hellip; too busy for long term work). GODDAMN I just wish there was a way to set up all the different config files to respond to the Xresources&amp;hellip;.. hmm&amp;hellip; Maybe I could figure something out&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking, I feel like I should try out OpenBSD. I am finally in a situation where my current setup is fully realized, and fairly stable. Somehow though, all I can think about is how fun it would be to drop this system for something percievably more stable and secure.
The only thing holding me back is the fear of software stability for my photo and video editing, also will switching fuck up my ability to cheat and do some things with DRM?</description>

      <description>Media Sharing So, I have a Plex server, and I use it for myself, and my father, and partner. But they don&amp;rsquo;t ever really use it. My father goes out of his way to use it, and avoids talking about it. What&amp;rsquo;s going on? If it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working, they could just let me know what&amp;rsquo;s going on. What&amp;rsquo;s the psychology behind that?? If anyone ever comes across this blog (unlikely) feel free to hit me up and let me know at tasha_saphir@protonmail.</description>

      <description>Ugh Shit, yall. I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling pretty crappy the past few days, I even had to skip work!! What am I going to do? The nausea is real. I&amp;rsquo;m fairly certain it isn&amp;rsquo;t COVID. I have my suspicions that it&amp;rsquo;s maybe all the tear gas and such in the air right now, along with all the forest fires right now. I&amp;rsquo;m in Portland, for reference.
 In other news, I&amp;rsquo;ve never been more nervous about sirens than I am during these times&amp;hellip; I wonder why?</description>

      <description>Plex Server Setup A Walkthrough I have finally found my perfect Plex setup, as shown in my post about setting up Artix (the subcategory about Servers is the example). My preferred setup is a boxed in Plex setup, to prevent access unwanted access from the UPnP ports.
Beginning Notes I believe we can collect installation notes from the https://natty-warhol.github.io/posts/2020/08/artixandrunit-install/. I prefer to avoid encryption so I can restart the computer remotely.</description>

      <description>Getting Away Sitting here on day 1 Million or so of our COVID trials, I watch Calvary, a film from 2014 with an all star cast of european actors (I don&amp;rsquo;t dare assume where they&amp;rsquo;re all from, I&amp;rsquo;m American and stupid). The film is about a Priest who is forced into a situation where a man angry at the Catholic church decides to kill a good priest for attention because of all the evils the bad priests have done.</description>

      <description>P.O.S. Point of Sale System I am working on a Proof of Concept POS System for my work, because I am tired of the constant problems presenting themselves when I least want them to. I am looking to switch to a completely disconnected, open source solution for work with multiple systems across two states and 5 stores. They are currently using very outdated (almost XP era) PCs with windows 10 locked down, with a shit POS system, and a terrible set up of permissions for apps and users.</description>

      <description>Is There a Better One? Is there a better version? Is there Another Version? Are there really infinite realities? Is my old boss really Batman?

      <description>Switching to Artix Personal Walkthrough What&amp;rsquo;s my Mission? I want to improve performance, security, and declutter my system by subverting Systemd. I also intend to encrypt my hard drive, as well as partial encryption of my internet traffic, whilst also using flatpak on large-library projects to avoid any system breakages.
USB Installation Grab the ISO from ArtixLinux.org, install with:
 sudo dd bs=4M if=path/to/image-runit.iso of=/dev/sdx status=progress oflag=sync
 Installation &amp;ndash; Prepare When booting into a UEFI Laptop (any laptop made in the past 8 years just about), make sure it is in UEFI mode, despite how you might feel, it is a form of check, and good for software security.</description>
